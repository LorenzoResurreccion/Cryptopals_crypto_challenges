On the Cryptopals website, they presented various coding challenges pertaining to various topics and ideas within cryptography. 
This repository stores my various attempts at creating solutions for these sets of challenges.

Set 1:\n
Challenge 1: Convert Hex to base64
Challenge 2: Fixed XOR
Challenge 3: Single-byte XOR cipher
Challenge 4: Detect single-character XOR
Challenge 5: Implement repeating-key XOR
Challenge 6: Break repeating-key XOR
Challenge 7: AES in ECB mode
Challenge 8: Detect AES in ECB mode
